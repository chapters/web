                <h2>What are Chapters?</h2>
                <p>
                Chapters are local or regional groups set up with the general goal of discussing standards, best described in
                the <a href="https://medium.com/@briankardell/web-standards-we-want-part-i-chapters-ca71985bf914">original post</a>
                about it. The general goal is to dramatically increase participation in, and education about, standards in new and
                manageable ways. In the words of <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org">The Extensible Web Manifesto</a>:
                To tighten the feedback loop between the editors of Web standards and developers. Essentially:
                </p>
                <ol style="text-align: left;">
			<li>Bring people together in local forums to discuss developing standards;</li>
			<li>Create a ‘safer’ and ‘easier’ place for developers to learn with mentoring;</li>
			<li>Get help reviewing both standards and human documentation around them;</li>
			<li>To enlist help in looking at or reviewing and developing prollyfills and tests with an eye toward 
			    improving standards;</li>
			<li>To introduce people to new technology and help them to try using it;</li>
			<li>Most importantly perhaps, to coalesce this feedback and information and feed it back into standards
			    bodies to manage noise and channels productively, so that Web developers finally have the voice
			    they deserve in the making of the technology they use every day.</li>

                    <h2>How do they work?</h2>
                    <p>There's no formal definition of how a chapter has to work, it's up to participants to determine what
                    they discuss or do, and how.  At a very basic level, we simply ask that chapters try to "keep track" of their work or discussions,
                    create very simple distilled notes or summaries and share <em>something</em> with the wider world where possible.
                    This can be in any form or medium that works - a github org or gist, a blog post, a post on <a href="https://discourse.specifiction.org">specifiction</a>, or some social media like G+ or Facebook.  The pilot group has found G+ to be a nice way for them to schedule meetups
                    and reminders and post some notes, and it uses Google Hangouts for remote participation, but your mileage may vary.
                    If you setup a group, let us know at <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/108958737038911231850/about">the main G+ org</a>
                    and we'll link you up and help you let people know about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our pilot partnered with the University of Vermont, who donated a dedicated space for 3 hours, one evening per week.
                    This isn't the only time or place where folks can talk, and not everyone can come every week or stay for the whole 3 hours,
                    but having a place where you <em>can</em> get together for some dedicated and substantial face-time seems helpful.
                    Initially, we introduced a newer people to the world of standards and helpful resources.
                    The model it eventually followed was simply to have people people start reading about things that were new to them, and
                    bring things they were interested in to the group's attention.  They would talk about it until they thought they understood it,
                    they would see what state of implementation it was in.  If none, they'd look for a polyfill and, if it wasn't listed on
                    helpful resources like MDN or Web Platform Docs, they might submit it.  They'd try it out and discuss it some more.
                    In some cases they were interested in potentially contributing Web Platform tests.
